🚀 **My Python Learning Journey!** 🐍  

Over the past year, I’ve been exploring Python, strengthening my fundamentals, and applying my knowledge through hands-on projects. I started with:  

✅ Variables & Data Types (int, float, string, boolean)  
✅ Conditional Statements (`if-else`, `elif`)  
✅ Loops (`for`, `while`)  
✅ Functions (parameters, return values)  
✅ Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries)  
✅ List & Dictionary Comprehensions  

After practicing multiple exercises, I took it a step further by building **three text-based management programs**:  
📌 **Student Management System**  
📌 **Library Management System**  
📌 **Hospital Management System**  

Each project helped me improve my **problem-solving skills, logic-building, and understanding of data structures**. With every step, I gained deeper insights into Python and its real-world applications.
